# SocialApp-MERN
This is a social media app created using the MERN stack and done by following a tutorial on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8YELRmUb5o
Some minor changes to the tutorial itself are: improvements made by other people, changed the image upload to be base64 dataUrl and not use Multer (my change)
